## Description
With Flame, we can create our own 2D games. The Flame Engine provides out-of-the-box components such as images, sprites, input, animations, collision detection, and much more. This project demonstrates how to create a simple 2D game called Gift Grab, where Santa must collect as many gifts as he can within 30 seconds.
